Welcome to Tim's website. It is run thanks to Jekyll(a Gem written in Ruby), and Github Pages. Here you may find things which interest you (or don't).

Jekyll offers support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tim')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tim' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
